# Heat-Flux-Prediction
The critical heat flux (CHF) corresponding to the departure from nucleate boiling (DNB) crisis is essential to the design and safety of a two-phase flow boiling system. work aims to apply a physics-informed ML aided hybrid framework to achieve superior predictive capabilities. Target feature is x_e_out which is a continuous variable &amp; RMSE score.
Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is 0.8082221563446738
